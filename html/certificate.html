        <h1>Innovation Challenge Compeititon</h1>
        <img src="../assets/ICC.png" alt="ICC" />
        <p>
          This contest was held by Binus University in January 2020. Me and my
          Friends lucky to present our innovation into this contest because our
          innovation get approved from our Lecturer and bring us as the Finalist
          of the Innovation Challenge Competition 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Innovation is about "Food Quality Detector". this innovation based
          on our problem that we can't figure the expired date of food that sell
          in marketplace. so we create innovation that maybe we can make some
          apps that supported by phone camera to detect the expired date of food
          based on its colour. Unfortunately, we can't win the competition
          because honestly we aren't prepared well.
